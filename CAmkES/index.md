# CAmkES

 CAmkES (component architecture for microkernel-based embedded
systems) is a software development and runtime framework for quickly and
reliably building microkernel-based multiserver (operating) systems. It
follows a component-based software engineering approach to software
design, resulting in a system that is modelled as a set of interacting
software components. These software components have explicit interaction
interfaces and a system design that explicitly details the connections
between the components.

The development framework provides:

- a language to describe component interfaces, components, and whole
      component-based systems
- a tool that processes these descriptions to combine
      programmer-provided component code with generated scaffolding and
      glue code to build a complete, bootable, system image
- full integration in the seL4 environment and build system

## Setting up your machine

- Make sure that you already have the tools to build seL4
  ([seL4: Setting up your machine](/GettingStarted#setting-up-your-machine))

## Download CAmkES


Download CAmkES source code from GitHub:
```
mkdir camkes-project
cd camkes-project
repo init -u https://github.com/seL4/camkes-manifest.git
repo sync
```

## Build and run simple application


The following will configure, build, and run a simple example CAmkES
system:
```
make arm_simple_defconfig
make silentoldconfig
```

If you haven't done so already, change the toolchain to the one for your
system. You can do this by running `make menuconfig`, then going to
**Toolchain Options -> Cross compiler prefix**. You will most
likely be compiling with **arm-linux-gnueabi-**.
```
make
qemu-system-arm -M kzm -nographic -kernel images/capdl-loader-experimental-image-arm-imx31
```

In order to clean up after building (for example because youâ€™ve set up a
new configuration and you want to make sure that everything gets rebuilt
correctly) do:

```
make clean
```

## Visual CAmkES


CAmkES comes with a tool for visualising the components and connections
making up an application. For more info, see [here](/VisualCAmkES).

## Changes in CAmkES 3


The current version of CAmkES introduces a number of syntactic and
functional changes. For details about what's changed, see
